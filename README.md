# Exploring Climate-Driven Shifts in UK Flowering Phenology üå∏üçÉ

## What's this project about?
In this honours project, you'll investigate how climate change is affecting flowering times (phenology) of UK plants. You'll use your interest in ecology, conservation biology, plant science, and evolution to identify trends, create predictive models, and consider how these changes might influence ecosystems.

**Original Keywords:** Ecology, Conservation biology, Plant science, Evolution, Computer modelling, Data analysis

---

## What will you do?

- Search for and analyse publicly available long-term phenology datasets.
- Identify and link suitable climate datasets (e.g., temperature, precipitation records).
- Use statistical approaches (like mixed-effects or Bayesian models) to explore relationships between climate and flowering patterns.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future changes in flowering dates.
- Reflect on what your findings mean for plant-pollinator interactions and overall ecosystem health.

## Finding Data

You'll need to locate and choose your own datasets. Possible places to start include citizen-science databases, climate databases, and open ecological repositories. Feel free to discuss your choices with me!

---

## What I expect from you

This is your project, and it should reflect your interests and creativity. It's designed to be:

- **Student-led**: Take charge, be proactive, and guide the direction of your project.
- **Independent**: Develop your own questions, solve your own challenges (with some help!), and make your own discoveries.
- **Flexible**: Projects can and should evolve. It's completely fine to adjust your focus as you learn more.

## How I'll help

I'm here as your supervisor and critical guide:

- I'll provide plenty of advice on coding (Python/R), statistical methods, and data interpretation.
- I won't do any direct data analysis or coding for you.
- I'm not a biologist or ecologist myself (although I find these areas fascinating!), so you'll need to engage deeply with the relevant literature and sources for biological context.

---

## What skills will you gain?

- Stronger coding and statistical analysis skills (Python/R)
- Experience in independent research and critical thinking
- Deeper understanding of climate change impacts on plant ecology

---

## How to start?

1. Start looking into available datasets.
2. Define some clear initial research questions based on your interests.
3. Prepare a short proposal outlining your ideas and methods.

I'm looking forward to seeing what you discover‚Äîreach out anytime if you need to chat!

Good luck and enjoy your journey! üå±‚ú®
